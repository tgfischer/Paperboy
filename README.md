This is a Reddit app that runs on Android. There are currently in beta, and is missing a lot of features (e.g., logging in, voting, searching, etc.). This app is something I'm doing in my spare time for now, but hopefully it will eventually become something that I can release to the app store.

Here are a few screenshots (taken April 14th, 2015)
