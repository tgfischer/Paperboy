This is a Reddit app that runs on Android. It is currently in beta, it is missing a lot of features (e.g., logging in, voting, searching, etc.), and the code is a little sloppy as a now (hopefully I can clean it up soon). This app is something I'm doing in my spare time for now, but hopefully it will eventually become something that I can release to the app store.

Here are a few screenshots (taken April 14th, 2015)
